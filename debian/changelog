ros-melodic-mpc-local-planner (0.0.2-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Added option to inherit the robot footprint model from the costmap_2d footprint by setting footprint type to costmap_2d (thanks to Alexander Xydes).
    Note that using a polygon as a robot footprint model is computationally more expensive than using two circle or line models.
  * Fixed issues in fd discretization grid and graph consistency
  * Fixed initialization of linear velocity output commands in simple car and unicycle models (thanks to Thomas Denewiler).
  * Fixed wrong parameter namespaces for some grid parameters
  * Replaced non-ASCII characters in python script
  * Added find_package script for osqp in case control_box_rst is linked against it
  * Contributors: Christoph Rösmann, Alexander Xydes, Thomas Denewiler
